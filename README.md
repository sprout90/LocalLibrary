# LocalLibrary
 Local library website 

## What is it?
A web page that provides library stats on members, books, and authors.  

## Why?
The focus of this assignment was to demonstrate profiency in advanced JavaScript array, list handling and high order functions. I had a lot of fun with this exercise as I was able to stretch my mental muscle by assembling nested array commands -- very powerful stuff. 

## My Focus
My focus as a student has been purely on the JavaScript in the src folder. The HTML and CSS were developed by THINKFUL.
